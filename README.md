Project Overview:

Some NBA statistics recorded today are brand new and haven’t been recorded throughout the history of professional basketball. Without these statistics, it’s difficult to make comprehensive comparisons between early professional basketball players and modern day NBA stars. Our objective is to create a linear regression model to estimate the VORP (value over replacement player) for those players who played in the era before VORP was able to be calculated. We intend to do this using metrics that have been recorded throughout the entire history of professional basketball from www.basketball-reference.com.
